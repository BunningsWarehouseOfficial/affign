## affign
Affign is an automatic image aligner for photo-a-day projects. This is a desktop application built to help users who need to align
potentially large sequences of images based on the face of the person in the image. It uses facial detection and landmark detection
(from Dlib) to detect the facial features and performs affine transformations (scaling/rotating/translating) on the images to align
them. The image manipulation is done with OpenCV and the GUI is built with wxWidgets.

### Using Affign
I plan to make Windows and MacOS pre-built executables available under "releases" but anyone should be able to build from source now that I have CMake support for the project. Users wishing to build from source must have wxWidgets and OpenCV installed as these are large libraries and wxWidgets doesn't yet have the CMake support I want, but *Dlib is dealt with entirely by the CMakeLists.txt file.* On that note, I do suggest using CMake to build Affign; though it is not absolutely necessary, it makes setting up the project trivial. Be sure to enable SSE4 or AVX instructions during CMake configuration to [make Dlib fast](http://dlib.net/faq.html#Whyisdlibslow).  

Once Affign is built, you will need a trained face predictor model, predictor.dat to be available to the executable at runtime in the same directory. This can be obtained from http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2. As mentioned [here](http://dlib.net/face_landmark_detection.py.html) this model was trained on the iBUG 300-W face landmark dataset which excludes commercial use. This model is **not** my property, but is included in the release files for Affign, for now. This is to make only one download necessary for end users.

### Inspiration
Credit to Matthew Earl's work [here](https://matthewearl.github.io/2016/01/22/portrait-timelapse/), which inspired me to create a full scale automatic aligner using OpenCV and Dlib.
