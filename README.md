## affign
Affign is an automatic image aligner for photo-a-day projects. This is a desktop application built to help users who need to align
potentially large sequences of images based on the face of the person in the image. It uses facial detection and landmark detection
(from Dlib) to detect the facial features and performs affine transformations (scaling/rotating/translating) on the images to align
them. The image manipulation is done with OpenCV and the GUI is built with wxWidgets.
